If you specify a result then In Control will take over (since the In Control rule will fire last). Use 'deny' to block the spawn. If 'allow' is used then the spawn will be allowed even if vanilla would normally disallow it (i.e. too much light). If 'default' is used then it is possible the spawn can still be denied if there is not enough light for example. Unless 'deny' is used then you can use any of the following actions",
